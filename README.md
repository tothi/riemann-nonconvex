# riemenn-nonconvex
Simulation of a totally asymmetric attractive interacting particle system

## Microscopic model
Markov jump process on a 1-dim discrete N-torus with rates c between neighbouring lattice points.

### Initial data
Step-function (Riemann problem)

## Files
* `runsim.sh`: script to run a bunch of simulations and create movies
* `sim/sim.c`: source code of the simulation

View the comments in `sim.c` to adjust parameters. Feel free to
customize `runsim.sh` to run the simulations needed.
